Description: The Hex Editor
 HT is a file editor/viewer/analyzer for executables. It also works perfectly
 as "normal" hex editor.
 .
 Supports among others ELF, COFF and Window PE as file formats and
 alpha, ia64, x86 and java as instruction sets.
 .
 The goal is to combine the low-level functionality of a debugger and the
 usability of IDEs.
